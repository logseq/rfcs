# Summary

Brief explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail
familiar with Logseq to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement.

# Drawbacks

Why should we _not_ do this?

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
